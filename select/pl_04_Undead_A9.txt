As I wake from sleep and look at the sky I don't
know
I see you reaching out to me
Don't let go of my hand and I'll take you with
me
while scattering lead from my clenched right
hand
I see you walking with me
I can't stay a corpse yet
I'm stepping on the black yesterday that came
out of the fog
Time stands still for you waiting for me
I'm walking in search of something in this other
world called reality
I'm picking up the shattered pieces over and
over again
I can hear your voice in the distance
Will you support me now and in the future?
If I never see you again in the future, I'll
stay a corpse.
Thank you, I won't end up a corpse
